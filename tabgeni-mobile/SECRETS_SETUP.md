# üîê GitHub Secrets Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure the GitHub secrets required for building, signing, and publishing the Tabgeni Android app to the Google Play Store.

## Required Secrets

The following secrets must be configured in your GitHub repository settings:

| Secret Name | Description | Required For |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded signing keystore | Release builds |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the keystore file | Release builds |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | Alias of the signing key within the keystore | Release builds |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for the specific signing key | Release builds |
| `PLAY_STORE_JSON` | Google Play Console service account JSON | Play Store deployment |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Generate a Signing Keystore

First, create a keystore file for signing your Android app:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-keystore.jks \
  -alias tabgeni-key \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Keystore password**: Create a strong password (save this for `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`)
- **Key password**: Create another strong password (save this for `KEY_PASSWORD`)
- **Distinguished Name fields**: Your name, organization, etc.

**Important Security Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit the keystore file to version control**
- üíæ **Backup the keystore in a secure location** (losing it means you can't update your app)
- üîí **Store passwords securely** (use a password manager)
- üìã **Document the key alias** (default shown above is `tabgeni-key`)

### 2. Encode the Keystore to Base64

Convert your keystore to Base64 format for GitHub Secrets:

```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
base64 -i release-keystore.jks -o keystore-base64.txt

# On Windows (PowerShell):
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("release-keystore.jks")) > keystore-base64.txt
```

The output file `keystore-base64.txt` will contain a long string. This is the value for `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`.

### 3. Create a Google Play Console Service Account

To automate Play Store uploads, you need a service account:

#### 3.1 Set Up API Access

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your app (or create it first with package name `com.tabgeni.app`)
3. Navigate to **Setup ‚Üí API access**
4. If you don't have a Google Cloud project linked:
   - Click **Create new Google Cloud project**
   - Follow the prompts to link it

#### 3.2 Create Service Account

1. Click **Create new service account**
2. Follow the link to Google Cloud Console
3. In Google Cloud Console:
   - Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**
   - **Service account name**: `tabgeni-playstore-deployer`
   - **Service account ID**: Auto-generated (or customize)
   - Click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**
   - Skip granting roles (we'll set them in Play Console)
   - Click **DONE**

#### 3.3 Generate Service Account Key

1. Find your new service account in the list
2. Click on it to open details
3. Go to the **KEYS** tab
4. Click **ADD KEY ‚Üí Create new key**
5. Choose **JSON** format
6. Click **CREATE**
7. The JSON file will download automatically - **keep this secure!**

#### 3.4 Grant Permissions in Play Console

1. Return to Play Console ‚Üí **Setup ‚Üí API access**
2. Find your service account in the list
3. Click **Grant access**
4. Under **App permissions**, select your app
5. Under **Account permissions**, grant at least:
   - ‚úÖ **View app information and download bulk reports**
   - ‚úÖ **Manage production releases**
   - ‚úÖ **Manage testing track releases** (for internal, alpha, beta tracks)
6. Click **Invite user** (or **Apply**)
7. Confirm the invitation

### 4. Add Secrets to GitHub

Now add all secrets to your GitHub repository:

#### 4.1 Navigate to Secrets Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. In the left sidebar, expand **Secrets and variables**
4. Click **Actions**
5. Click **New repository secret**

#### 4.2 Add Each Secret

Add the following secrets one by one:

**`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`**
```
# Copy the entire contents of keystore-base64.txt
# Should be a very long string with no line breaks
```

**`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`**
```
# The password you created for the keystore file
# Example: MySecureKeystorePassword123!
```

**`KEY_ALIAS`**
```
# The alias you used when creating the keystore
# If you followed the guide above: tabgeni-key
```

**`KEY_PASSWORD`**
```
# The password for the specific key
# Example: MySecureKeyPassword456!
```

**`PLAY_STORE_JSON`**
```json
# Copy the ENTIRE contents of the service account JSON file downloaded from Google Cloud
# It should look like this (this is just an example, yours will be different):
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "abc123...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "tabgeni-playstore-deployer@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/..."
}
```

## Verification

### Test the Secrets

To verify your secrets are configured correctly:

1. **Create a test release tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0-test
   git push origin v0.1.0-test
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow:**
   - Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
   - Watch the "Android Release" workflow execute
   - Check for errors in the build logs

3. **Verify Play Console upload:**
   - Go to Google Play Console
   - Navigate to **Release ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Internal testing**
   - Look for your new release

4. **Clean up test release:**
   ```bash
   # Delete tag locally
   git tag -d v0.1.0-test
   
   # Delete tag remotely
   git push --delete origin v0.1.0-test
   ```

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid keystore format"
- Ensure the Base64 string has no line breaks
- Verify you encoded the correct `.jks` file
- Check the keystore password is correct

#### "Service account does not have permission"
- Verify service account permissions in Play Console
- Ensure the correct JSON file is used
- Check if the app exists in Play Console with correct package name

#### "Could not find any *.apk or *.aab files"
- Check that the build completed successfully
- Verify the build paths in the workflow match your project structure
- Look for Gradle build errors earlier in the logs

#### "First upload must be done manually"
- Google requires the first APK/AAB to be uploaded manually via Play Console
- After the first manual upload, automation will work for subsequent versions

## Security Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Store keystore backups in a secure, encrypted location  
‚úÖ Use a password manager for keystore passwords  
‚úÖ Rotate service account keys periodically  
‚úÖ Limit service account permissions to minimum required  
‚úÖ Use separate keystores for debug and release builds  
‚úÖ Document the key alias and store it securely  

### DON'T:
‚ùå Commit keystore files to Git  
‚ùå Share keystore passwords in plain text  
‚ùå Use the same passwords across multiple services  
‚ùå Store keystore on shared network drives  
‚ùå Email or message keystore files  
‚ùå Use simple or guessable passwords  

## Keystore Recovery

If you lose your keystore:

### Option 1: Find a Backup
- Check secure backup locations
- Look for encrypted storage
- Ask team members who may have copies

### Option 2: Contact Google (New Apps Only)
- For apps enrolled in **App Signing by Google Play**
- Google manages the upload key, you can reset it
- This only works if you enrolled when publishing

### Option 3: Start Over (Last Resort)
- Create a new app with a different package name
- Users will need to reinstall (can't update existing installs)
- Lose all existing ratings and reviews
- **Avoid this at all costs!**
